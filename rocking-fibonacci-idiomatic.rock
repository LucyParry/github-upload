Fibonacci takes everything
The numbers are ubiquitous
Nature is mathematics
The pattern is recursions
Until the pattern is everything
Whisper the numbers
Put the numbers with nature into the universe
Put nature into the numbers
Put the universe into nature
Build the pattern up

Give back nothing

Forever is some number
Fibonacci taking forever
